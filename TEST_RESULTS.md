# Test Results for PR 1863

## Environment Information
- **OS**: Linux (Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS)
- **Swift Version**: 6.2 (swift-6.2-RELEASE)
- **Date**: 2025-10-12

## Issue Summary
This PR contains changes related to injecting `__type = @"Object"` when missing but className/objectId are present.

## Testing Limitations

### Platform Requirements
The Parse SDK for iOS/macOS requires:
- macOS operating system
- Xcode (versions 15 or 16 recommended)
- iOS Simulator or physical devices
- Ruby with Bundler for running Rake tasks

### Current Environment
The current test environment is running on Linux, which does not have:
- Xcode build tools
- iOS/macOS frameworks (Foundation, UIKit, etc.)
- iOS/tvOS/watchOS simulators

### Build Attempt Results

**Swift Package Manager Build**: ‚ùå Failed
```
Error: Foundation/Foundation.h file not found
```

The Parse SDK uses Apple-specific frameworks that are not available on Linux. The build fails immediately when trying to compile Objective-C code that imports Foundation.

## Recommended Testing Approach

To properly test this PR, the following tests should be run on macOS with Xcode:

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
gem install bundler -v 2.5.22
bundle install
```

### 2. Run Core Module Tests
```bash
# iOS Tests (iOS 17 or 18)
bundle exec rake test:ios

# macOS Tests
bundle exec rake test:macos
```

### 3. Run LiveQuery Module Tests (if applicable)
```bash
# iOS LiveQuery Tests
bundle exec rake test:parse_live_query:ios

# macOS LiveQuery Tests
bundle exec rake test:parse_live_query:osx

# tvOS LiveQuery Tests
bundle exec rake test:parse_live_query:tvos

# watchOS LiveQuery Tests
bundle exec rake test:parse_live_query:watchos
```

### 4. Build Starter Projects
```bash
bundle exec rake build:starters
```

## Test Coverage Focus Areas

Based on the PR description mentioning `__type = @"Object"` injection, the following test areas should be carefully reviewed:

1. **Decoder Tests** (`Parse/Tests/Unit/DecoderTests.m`)
   - Test object decoding with and without `__type` field
   - Verify pointer stub handling
   - Check dictionary path fallback behavior

2. **Object File Coder Tests** (`Parse/Tests/Unit/ObjectFileCoderTests.m`)
   - Test encoding/decoding of objects
   - Verify className and objectId handling

3. **Field Operation Decoder Tests** (`Parse/Tests/Unit/FieldOperationDecoderTests.m`)
   - Test field operations with various object states

## Continuous Integration

The GitHub Actions CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs comprehensive tests on:
- Multiple Xcode versions (15 and 16)
- Multiple platform versions (iOS 17, iOS 18, macOS 14, macOS 15, etc.)
- All modules (Core, LiveQuery)
- All platforms (iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS)

The CI will automatically run these tests when the PR is opened/updated.

## Conclusion

**Status**: Unable to run unit tests in current Linux environment

**Recommendation**: 
1. Review the GitHub Actions CI results for this PR
2. If CI is not available, run tests locally on macOS using the commands above
3. Focus testing on object decoding/encoding functionality related to the `__type` field
4. Verify backward compatibility with existing code that may rely on the dictionary path

## Next Steps

To complete testing of this PR:
- [ ] Wait for GitHub Actions CI to complete (or trigger manually)
- [ ] Review CI test results
- [ ] Check for any failing tests related to object decoding
- [ ] Verify all platforms pass tests (iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS)
- [ ] Review code coverage reports if available
