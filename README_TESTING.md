# Testing Documentation for PR 1863

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for testing PR 1863, which modifies the `PFDecoder` to inject `__type = @"Object"` for dictionaries with className/objectId and additional fields.

## üéØ Quick Status

**Static Validation**: ‚úÖ PASSED (14/14 checks)  
**Unit Tests**: ‚è≥ Require macOS with Xcode  
**Documentation**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Test Scripts**: ‚úÖ READY

## Quick Start

### On macOS with Xcode
```bash
./run_tests.sh
```

### On Linux or without Xcode
Read the documentation files to understand:
- What changed in the PR
- How to test on macOS
- What tests should pass
- What to look for in CI results

## Documentation Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **SUMMARY.md** | Executive summary of testing task and outcomes |
| **UNIT_TEST_GUIDE.md** | Detailed guide with code analysis and test instructions |
| **TEST_RESULTS.md** | Environment analysis and platform requirements |
| **run_tests.sh** | Automated test runner script for macOS |

## Key Points

1. **Platform**: Tests require macOS with Xcode (iOS/macOS SDK)
2. **PR Changes**: Adds logic to inject `__type = @"Object"` in decoder
3. **Test Files**: `DecoderTests.m`, `ObjectFileCoderTests.m`, `FieldOperationDecoderTests.m`
4. **CI**: GitHub Actions will run comprehensive tests automatically

## Testing Approach

### Automated (Recommended)
1. Wait for GitHub Actions CI to complete
2. Review test results in Actions tab
3. Verify all platforms pass (iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS)

### Manual (If CI not available)
1. Clone repository on macOS
2. Run `./run_tests.sh`
3. Review test output
4. Check for any failures in decoder tests

## What to Verify

- ‚úÖ Objects with additional fields get `__type` injected
- ‚úÖ Bare pointer stubs (only className/objectId) remain as dictionaries
- ‚úÖ Existing tests continue to pass
- ‚úÖ No performance regression
- ‚úÖ All platforms supported (iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS)

## Need Help?

1. Read `UNIT_TEST_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions
2. Check `TEST_RESULTS.md` for platform requirements
3. Review `SUMMARY.md` for high-level overview
4. Run `./run_tests.sh` on macOS for automated testing
